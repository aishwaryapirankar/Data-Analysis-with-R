# Data-Analysis-with-R-Spotify-API - Taylor Swift

We are doing data analysis of **Taylor Swift** (born in _1989_)'s music as she is my favorite artist. Currently, she is re-recording her first five albums for owning her masters is truly inspiring and a story that needs to be shared for _evermore_. She has a great _reputation_ for her _fearless_ songwriting and mind blowing performances across many genres. 

This is my first Data Analysis project with R. I wanted to learn about the most useful packages for data analysis. I referred to the documentation and few videos along with articles for packages like spotifyr, tidyverse, knitr and ggridges.

First, to get the data I used the Spotify API for developers and created a token variable to access Spotify data for the project.

We have a Taylor Swift song for every mood, but these are the songs with highest valence (Tracks with high valence sound more positive, happy, cheerful, euphoric according to Spotify)
